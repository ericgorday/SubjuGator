# VideoRay Thruster Firmware Configuration
This directory contains the firmware configurations meant to be used with our VideoRay m5 thrusters.
* The settings in this directory will be applied to thrusters with corresponding NODE_ID's.
* A setting that cannot be set using the VideoRay CSR comms protocol is the maximum allowable power.
* Any permanent chenges to the firmware configuration for a specific thruster should be reflected
  here.
